This project involves the analysis of an e-commerce database containing purchase data from approximately 4,000 customers over the span of one year. The primary objective was to uncover meaningful customer segments and predict future purchasing behavior. Using K-Means Clustering, a predictive model was developed that identifies patterns in customer transactions and categorizes them into distinct clusters. This model is capable of anticipating the future purchases of a new customer based on their initial transaction, offering valuable insights for targeted marketing and personalized recommendations.
